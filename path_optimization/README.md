Steps to run path optimization on your own computer

1. Create a virtual environment using the command "python -m venv venv"

2. Activate the virtual environment using the command ".\venv\Scripts\activate" (This command is for Windows)

3. Install the required libraries by running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" (Note that if there are still import errors, you can run "pip install <library_name> to install it)

4. Change the filename variable in PathOptimization.py (Use the absolute file path or else Mission Planner can't read it)
